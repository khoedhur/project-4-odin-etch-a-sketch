# The Odin Project 4: Etch-a-Sketch
Project 4 of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch)

This project's goal is to create a webpage that has a certain amount of cells that change colors as you move your mouse over them

You can also generate a new grid by clicking on a button

The project's main purpose is to practice using event listeners and DOM manipulation


## Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases the following skills:
* Event Listeners
* DOM Manipulation
  * appendChild


## Things to work on

* Generating a new grid creates one under the original 16
* Centering the container/cells
  * justify-content: center and align-items: center did not seem to work
* Scaling the size of the cells with a fixed width when rows and columns exceed a certain number (around 25)
* Implementing a progressive darkening effect where hovering over a cell increases its color/black by 10% each time
